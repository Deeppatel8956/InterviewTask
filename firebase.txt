  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
6. What is Firebase Authentication, and how do you use it?
Answer:
Firebase Authentication is a service that helps you manage users and their authentication state in your app. It supports various authentication methods like email/password, Google sign-in, Facebook, and more.

Example of Email/Password Authentication:

javascript
Copy
const auth = firebase.auth();
auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
  .then((userCredential) => {
    var user = userCredential.user;
    console.log('User signed up:', user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    var errorCode = error.code;
    var errorMessage = error.message;
    console.error(errorCode, errorMessage);
  });
7. What is Firebase Firestore and how is it different from Firebase Realtime Database?
Answer:
Firebase Firestore is a flexible, scalable database that allows for more complex queries and data structures. Firestore stores data in collections and documents, which is more organized and scalable compared to the Realtime Database’s JSON structure. Firestore also supports better querying capabilities and offline data persistence.

8. What is Firebase Hosting, and how do you deploy an app?
Answer:
Firebase Hosting is a fast and secure web hosting platform for static files (HTML, CSS, JS). You can deploy single-page web apps or full-fledged static websites using Firebase Hosting.

To deploy an app:

Install Firebase CLI: npm install -g firebase-tools
Initialize Firebase in your project: firebase init
Build your app (if required).
Deploy using: firebase deploy
9. What is Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)?
Answer:
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a service that enables you to send push notifications to users across different platforms (iOS, Android, and web). FCM allows you to send notifications to a single device, a group of devices, or even to all devices.

10. How can you enable offline support in Firebase?
Answer:
Firebase provides built-in offline support. When a device loses connection, Firebase automatically stores changes locally. When the connection is restored, Firebase synchronizes the changes with the cloud.

For Firestore:

javascript
Copy
firebase.firestore().enablePersistence()
  .catch((err) => {
    if (err.code === 'failed-precondition') {
      console.log('Multiple tabs open, persistence may not work.');
    } else if (err.code === 'unimplemented') {
      console.log('Persistence is not available on this browser.');
    }
  });
11. What is Firebase Analytics?
Answer:
Firebase Analytics is a free, unlimited analytics solution that helps you understand your app’s usage. It provides insights into user behavior, which can be used for improving user engagement and optimizing app performance.

12. What are Firebase Security Rules?
Answer:
Firebase Security Rules control how your data can be read or written in Firebase Realtime Database, Firestore, and Firebase Storage. They allow you to enforce security and access restrictions based on user authentication or other conditions.

Example rule to allow users to read and write only their data:

json
Copy
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$user_id": {
        ".read": "$user_id === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$user_id === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}

Answer:
Firebase Cloud Functions allow you to run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. These functions are hosted in Google's cloud, so you don't need to manage a server. They can be used for tasks like sending notifications, processing data, or interacting with third-party APIs.

Example of a Cloud Function that triggers on a new user creation:

javascript
Copy
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp();

exports.sendWelcomeEmail = functions.auth.user().onCreate((user) => {
  const email = user.email;
  // Send welcome email logic
  console.log(`Welcome email sent to ${email}`);
});
14. How do you authenticate a user with Firebase using Google Sign-In?
Answer:
Firebase provides simple methods to integrate Google authentication. Here’s an example of how to authenticate using Google Sign-In:

Add Firebase and Google sign-in SDK:

bash
Copy
npm install firebase
Set up Firebase Authentication with Google:

javascript
Copy
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(provider)
  .then((result) => {
    const user = result.user;
    console.log('User signed in: ', user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.code, error.message);
  });
15. What are Firebase Firestore’s data types?
Answer:
Firebase Firestore supports several data types:

String: A sequence of characters.
Number: Integer or floating-point numbers.
Boolean: true or false.
Array: An ordered list of values.
Map: A nested collection of key-value pairs (similar to an object).
Timestamp: A point in time.
GeoPoint: Latitude and longitude coordinates.
Reference: A reference to another document in Firestore.
Example:

javascript
Copy
db.collection("users").doc("user_id").set({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
  timestamp: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});
16. What is the difference between Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database?
Answer:

Firebase Authentication: Handles user authentication (sign up, login, password reset) and stores user information such as email, display name, etc.
Firebase Realtime Database: A cloud-hosted database that stores data in real-time, synced across all connected devices instantly.
They can be used together. For example, after a user logs in using Firebase Authentication, their data can be stored and retrieved from the Firebase Realtime Database.

17. How can you ensure that Firebase Cloud Firestore is secure?
Answer:
Firebase Firestore uses Firebase Security Rules to control access to the database. To ensure security, you can set rules based on user authentication and authorization.

Example rule to ensure that only authenticated users can read and write data:

json
Copy
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
18. How do you handle errors in Firebase?
Answer:
Firebase provides try-catch mechanisms for handling errors. You can catch errors when working with Firebase services like Firestore, Authentication, and Realtime Database.

Example of error handling when signing in:

javascript
Copy
firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
  .then((userCredential) => {
    const user = userCredential.user;
    console.log('User signed in: ', user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    const errorCode = error.code;
    const errorMessage = error.message;
    console.error('Error signing in:', errorCode, errorMessage);
  });
19. What is Firebase Dynamic Links?
Answer:
Firebase Dynamic Links allow you to create links that work across platforms and survive the app installation process. For example, if a user receives a link to a specific screen in your app but does not have the app installed, Dynamic Links can guide them to install the app and then open the intended screen after installation.

Example:

javascript
Copy
const dynamicLink = await firebase.dynamicLinks().buildShortLink({
  link: 'https://www.example.com/special-offer',
  domainUriPrefix: 'https://example.page.link',
  androidInfo: {
    androidPackageName: 'com.example.app',
  },
  iosInfo: {
    iosBundleId: 'com.example.app',
  },
});
20. How do you monitor and analyze app performance using Firebase?
Answer:
Firebase provides Firebase Performance Monitoring, which helps track the performance of your app and diagnose issues like slow network requests or screen rendering times. You can monitor app performance through the Firebase console.

To get started:

Set up Firebase Performance SDK in your app.
Use custom traces to measure specific parts of your app (e.g., a specific function or network request).
The data is then available on the Firebase Console under the Performance tab.
Example of custom trace:

javascript
Copy
const trace = firebase.performance().newTrace('custom_trace');
trace.start();
// Perform actions you want to measure
trace.stop();
21. What are the Firebase Cloud Storage rules?
Answer:
Firebase Cloud Storage uses security rules to manage who can upload, download, and delete files. These rules can be based on user authentication and other conditions.

Example rule to allow users to upload only to their own folder:

json
Copy
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /user_uploads/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
22. How do you delete a Firebase user?
Answer:
To delete a user from Firebase Authentication, you can use the delete() method on the user object. However, make sure to re-authenticate the user if their session has expired.

Example:

javascript
Copy
const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
user.delete()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('User deleted successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error deleting user:', error);
  });
23. What is Firebase Test Lab?
Answer:
Firebase Test Lab is a service that allows you to run automated tests on your app across a wide range of real devices hosted in Google data centers. This helps you identify issues and bugs in your app before it is released to production.

Test Lab supports tests for both Android and iOS apps. You can integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.
